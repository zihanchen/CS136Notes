##C operators

The multiplication operators are left-associative

* operator in C is the same as Racket
* they are written in normal ways
* When working with integers, the division operator trunacates
any intermediate value and behaves the same as the Racket 
quotient funcion
Example:
```C
const int a = (4 * 5) / 2; //10
const int b = 4 * (5 / 2); //8!!
const int c = -5 / 2; //-2!!
```
